          <p>Published on October 15, 2021</p>

            <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish that is easy to make and incredibly delicious. The dish
            is made with spaghetti, pancetta or bacon, eggs, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. The result is a creamy,
            savory pasta dish that is perfect for any occasion.</p>
          <p>To make Spaghetti Carbonara, start by cooking the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until it
            is al dente. While the spaghetti is cooking, cook the pancetta or bacon in a large skillet over medium heat
            until it is crispy. Remove the pancetta or bacon from the skillet and set it aside.</p>
          <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. Drain the spaghetti and add it
            to the skillet with the pancetta or bacon. Toss the spaghetti with the pancetta or bacon until it is coated in
            the fat. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the egg mixture to the skillet. Toss the spaghetti with the
            egg mixture until it is coated in the sauce.</p>
          <p>Be sure to toss the spaghetti quickly with the egg mixture so that the eggs do not scramble. The heat from
            the spaghetti will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. Serve the Spaghetti Carbonara immediately with
            additional Parmesan cheese and black pepper.</p>
